001#
First Bubble.
–
Second Bubble. This one is not supposed to be on the same panel as the previous bubble.
–
[nib] Not that it really matters : it's just to show that some special characters can be ignored. In this case, a long dash was on the previous line to signify a change of panel.
[sfxib] Another bubble, this one is a double-bubble. First part is sfxib styled.
// Second part, will be a "sfxib" too, because no style has been defined on this line.
Another double-bubble. First part is "yelling" style. [yelling]
// The second part, on the other hand, will be "handwritten". [handwritten]


002# [italic] [[all the bubbles on this page will be written in "italic", unless the style is overriden on a line]]
[nib] A text not in bubble.
A big bubble...
// All the part of this multi-bubble will be written in "italic".
// Because no override style has been defined, and the page style is "italic".
Giga pudding! [yelling] [[this bubble will be written in "yelling" style, even if the page was set to "italic"]]
[nib] New note definition [handwritten][[a simple note]][[and another]]


003#
[blank] [[this page has no text, it won't be typesetted, and this note won't be taken into account]]


004# [[not a style, just a note]]
[sfx] Some sfx
[newspaper] Tonight at eleven.
[sfxib] Sfx in balloon.


005#
[nib] "nib", yes, but we want to override this one with "handwritten". [handwritten]
–
[[There's nothing to typeset here, but we should still display the note]][[or notes]]
–
[[glop]]


006# [italic]
[nib] More vicious : an "italic" page style, with a "nib" that should be "handwritten". [handwritten]
–
A multipart bubble. Of which the first part is "yelling". [yelling]
// The second should then be "yelling" too.
–
[nib] And the ultimate combo. First "nib". [[vicious I said]]
// Then second "yelling". [yelling] [[believe it]]
// Then third. Should be "yelling" too, because it inherits from the previous part. [[yes it does]]
// And last. "Handwritten". [handwritten] [[push it]]
–
And this one should be "italic", since the page is "italic".
–
Dirty trick.
// [handwritten] The style was placed right after the double-slash. It works too.
[sfxib] // The style was defined BEFORE the double-slash. This is invalid and the line will be considered a bubble on its own.


007# [[Although there's nothing to typeset on this page, this note will be displayed nonetheless]]
[blank]


008-009#
This one is supposed to be a double page.
[nib] This bubble has a note and a style set after the note. Does it work? [[yes it does]] [other_style]


010# [[we have single word notes in this page]]
Screw this [[censored]]
[nib] Screw that [[censored_too]]

Everything that appears after the END anchor won't be taken into account either.
